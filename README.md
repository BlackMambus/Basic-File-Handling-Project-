# Basic-File-Handling-Project-

File handling in C++ allows programs to read from and write to files on the disk, enabling data persistence beyond the runtime of the application. The C++ Standard Library provides the <fstream> header, which includes three main classes for file operations:

ifstream â€“ for reading from files (input file stream)

ofstream â€“ for writing to files (output file stream)

fstream â€“ for both reading and writing (file stream)
